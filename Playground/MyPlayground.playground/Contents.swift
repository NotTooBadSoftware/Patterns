This will parse expressions like "1+2-3^(4*3)/2".

The top expression is called first. ‚Ä¢ !any means it must match the entire string, because only at the end of the string is there no characters. If you want to match multiple arithmetic expressions in a string, comment out the first expression. Grammars use dynamic properties so there is no auto-completion for the expression names.
